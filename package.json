To get the app up and running perform the following steps: - clone the repository - put the network graph data as `.ttl` file in the `/public` directory - create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPH_TTL` to the file name of the graph data file - run `npm install` to install the dependencies - run `npm run dev` to spin up the development server - run `npm run build` to build the project - run `npm run start` to serve (locally) a previously built version of the app    ## Update the graph data Replace the `.ttl` file that lives in `/public` and change the environment variable accordingly if you change the file name.",
